    A few challenges for you involving variables and data types,
    specifically single variables and lists.

    Directions: 
    In this file you will find functions that need to be
    build to accomplist a particular objective. In order to test your
    solution I have written a unit test file that has the extension of
    .ut.py attributed to it.

    In the test file there is a test for each function,
    you will need to uncomment each test as you go to check your
    solution. Once they are uncommented and passing, there
    is no need to comment them out again.
'''
class varConversion(object):

    '''
        @param: 'a' - is passed in as a single string.
        Objective: convert 'a' to an integer and return it.
    '''
    def toInt(a):
        pass


    '''
        @param: 'a' - is passed in as a single iteger.
        Objective: convert 'a' to a string and return it.
    '''
    def toStr(a):
        pass


    '''
        @param: 'a' - is passed in as a list of strings. e.g. ['1','2','3','4','5']
        Objective: Convert each number within the list into an integer, multiply it by two, and return a new list.
    '''
    def arrToInt(a):
        pass

    '''
        @param: 'a' is passed in as a list of strings.
        Objective: Remove the third item in the list and then return it.
    '''
    def thirdElement(a):
        pass
